# Calculator


## Description

    The motivation for building this project was too see the grasp of my understanding of HTML, CSS, and most importantly JavaScript. This project is part of the Odin Project Foundations curriculum. 
    I built this project because it relates key components such as functions, event listeners and CSS design elements. With this program commonly known as the calculator, one will be able to perform computations of limited variety. This current design is only capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Furthermore it has keyboard support!, feel free to click on the buttons or simply pressodown on the desired keys. 
    This is my first project which really tested my knowledge and quite frankly my ability to stay calm. It becomes difficult struggling with concepts one is unfamiliar with. Through the journey of this calculator i've gained a better understanding of 
    - CSS Grid
    - DOM Elements
    - Event Listeners ("Click" and "Keydown")
    - Nested Functions
    - Variable Scope
    - Breaking down a project into the smallest bits possible
    These are just the elements which I found to be crucial for this project.
